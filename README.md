# Corona_test
This project is used to predict whether a person has COVID virus or not based on the symptoms.
I have classified the persons based on the information provided by the WHO.
It will predict based on the symptoms of some people from a file name person_data_corona.txt.
Then it will generate a report of each person based on the questions asked in the file. 
The report of the person will be created with the persons name and based on the severity of symptoms.
